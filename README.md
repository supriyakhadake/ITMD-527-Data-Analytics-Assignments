# Basic Model Building

***Multiple Linear Regression***

- Descriptive statistic of the dataset
- Find correlation
  - Correlation plot
- Check association between variables with the help of scatter plot.
- Build Multiple Linear Regression model.
    - Model Selection:
      - Goodness of Fit test
      - Individual parameter test
      - Coefficient of determination (adj-R2)
- Perform Residual Analysis on the best model
  - Constant Variance
  - Linearity distribution
  - Normality test
  - Influential Points
